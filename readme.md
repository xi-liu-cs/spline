This project is done for computer graphics course at New York University, fall 2022, using WebGL.<br>
An aircraft made of meshes such as extrusions and surface of revolutions that are constructed from splines. Many different kinds of splines are created through bezier, hermite, catmull-rom, and b-spline matrices. For the revolution mesh, $z$ and $r$ values are computed through the ```evalCubicSpline()``` function. Can click ```start or stop movement``` button to start or stop the plane's rotation.
